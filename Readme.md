# 🎓 No Framework Project *Presentation letter*

 - 📚 Example aplication portfolio just using `HTML5`, `CSS3` and `Javascript`.

 - 💡 The idea of ​​the project is to improve the use of html, css and javascript in order not to use a framework but still create responsive websites with high design.

 - A page that talks about me, my knowledge and technologies that I have experiences, with links to my social networks. Go to [My Website](https://presentation-letter-xi.vercel.app/) to see the page, or see my [portfolio](https://joao-eduardo-portfolio.vercel.app).
